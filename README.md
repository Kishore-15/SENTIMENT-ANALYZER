# SENTIMENT-ANALYZER
Create a real-time sentiment analysis system that monitors social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. User opinions  spread rapidly and often affect a company's public image and stock prices.  A negative  post going viral can severely harm a brand's reputation. Classifies posts  into positive, neutral, or negative categories.
